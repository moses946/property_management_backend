## Communication

1. **Primary Communication Tool**:
   - Use [Slack/Discord/WhatsApp] for daily communication and quick updates.
   - Use GitHub Issues or a task board (e.g., Trello/Jira) for task tracking.

2. **Regular Sync-ups**:
   - Schedule a brief check-in every [day/week] to discuss progress and blockers.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Document major decisions in a shared `docs/` folder or on a cloud-based document (e.g., Google Docs).

---

## Branching and Version Control

1. **Main Branch**:
   - The `main` branch will always contain stable, production-ready code.

2. **Feature Branches**:
   - Create a branch for each new feature or bug fix.
   - Use the naming convention: `feature/<short-description>` or `fix/<short-description>`.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/authentication
     ```

3. **Pull Requests**:
   - Always create a pull request (PR) to merge feature branches into `main`.
   - Tag the other collaborator for a review before merging.

4. **Commit Messages**:
   - Use meaningful and consistent commit message
   - Format: `<type>: <description>`
     - **feat**: A new feature.
     - **fix**: A bug fix.
     - **refactor**: Code restructuring without changing functionality.
     - **docs**: Updates to documentation.
     - **style**: Code formatting changes.

---

## Task Management

1. **Define Tasks Clearly**:
   - Break down tasks into actionable items.
   - Assign tasks explicitly using GitHub Issues or your chosen task tracker.

2. **Track Progress**:
   - Move tasks through states like `To Do`, `In Progress`, and `Done`.

---

## Coding Standards

1. **Code Formatting**:
   - Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for consistent formatting.
   - Agree on a style guide, such as Airbnb’s JavaScript Style Guide.

2. **Code Reviews**:
   - Review each other’s pull requests.
   - Ensure the code is clean, readable, and meets project requirements.

3. **Commenting**:
   - Use comments to explain complex logic.
   - Avoid redundant comments that state the obvious.

4. **Modularity**:
   - Write small, reusable functions and keep files focused on a single responsibility.

---

## Workflow

1. **Development Setup**:
   - Both collaborators should use the same environment and dependencies.
   - Use a shared `.env.example` for environment variables.

2. **Testing**:
   - Test your changes locally before pushing.
   - Write tests for critical features or changes.

3. **Continuous Integration (Optional)**:
   - Set up a basic CI pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing and linting.

---

## Handling Conflicts

1. **Merge Conflicts**:
   - Communicate before making changes to shared files.
   - Use Git to resolve conflicts locally:
     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     git merge <branch-name>
     ```

2. **Discussions**:
   - Use a shared document or issue tracker to discuss and resolve disagreements.

---

## Deployment

1. **Staging Environment**:
   - Test new changes on a staging environment before deploying to production.

2. **Deployment Strategy**:
   - Agree on a deployment process, e.g., using [Netlify, Vercel, or Heroku].

3. **Shared Responsibility**:
   - Rotate deployment tasks to ensure both collaborators are familiar with the process.

---

## Security

1. **Secrets Management**:
   - Use `.env` files to store sensitive information. Never hardcode secrets in the codebase.
   - Share secrets securely (e.g., via encrypted messages or password managers).

2. **Code Scanning**:
   - Regularly scan for vulnerabilities using tools like **npm audit** or **Snyk**.

---

## Documentation

1. **Update Regularly**:
   - Document APIs, workflows, and major decisions in a `docs/` folder or shared tool.

2. **README**:
   - Keep the `README.md` up to date with setup instructions, key features, and usage notes.

---

## Example Task Workflow

1. **Assign a Task**:
   - Define a new task in the tracker and assign it to yourself or your colleague.

2. **Create a Branch**:
   - Start a new branch for the task:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/implement-login
     ```

3. **Write Code**:
   - Implement the task and ensure it adheres to the coding standards.

4. **Push Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: implement user login"
   git push origin feature/implement-login
